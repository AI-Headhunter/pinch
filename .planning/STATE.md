## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Group channels deferred to v2 -- get 1:1 solid first, complexity cost is high
- [Roadmap]: Phases 4 and 5 can execute in parallel (both depend only on Phase 3), but Phase 4 prioritized because agents are intermittently offline during dev testing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenClaw skill integration specifics: exact OpenClaw API surface needs validation against actual OpenClaw docs when skill is being built (Phase 3)
